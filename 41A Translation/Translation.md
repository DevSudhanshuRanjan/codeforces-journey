## Problem Statement

The translation from the Berland language into the Birland language is not an easy task. Those languages are very similar: a Berlandish word differs from a Birlandish word with the same meaning a little: it is spelled (and pronounced) reversely. For example, a Berlandish word code corresponds to a Birlandish word edoc. However, making a mistake during the "translation" is easy. Vasya translated the word **s** from Berlandish into Birlandish as **t**. Help him: find out if he translated the word correctly.

## Input

The first line contains word **s**, the second line contains word **t**. The words consist of lowercase Latin letters. The input data do not contain unnecessary spaces. The words are not empty and their lengths do not exceed 100 symbols.

## Output

If the word **t** is a word **s**, written reversely, print `YES`, otherwise print `NO`.
